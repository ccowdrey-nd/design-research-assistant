# Export Feature Troubleshooting

## ✅ Export System Status

**Backend:** Working perfectly - detects ANY asset request  
**Frontend:** Code deployed - just needs browser refresh

---

## 🔧 If Download Button Doesn't Appear

### Quick Fix: Hard Refresh Browser

**At http://localhost:3000:**
- **Mac**: Press **Cmd + Shift + R**
- **Windows**: Press **Ctrl + Shift + R**

Or:
- Close the browser tab completely
- Reopen http://localhost:3000

---

## 🧪 Test After Refresh

**Type in chat:**
```
"I'm looking to download the house icon in lawn"
```

**You should see:**
1. Response: "I can export that for you! Click the download button below..."
2. **[📥 Download Asset SVG (#1B8751)]** ← This button should appear!
3. Click → Spinner → Download

---

## 🎨 What You Can Export

**The system now handles ANY asset from Brand Asset Kit:**

### Examples That Work:
- "Download the house icon in lawn" ✅
- "Export the wordmark in dusk" ✅
- "Get me the vista illustration" ✅
- "Download the pine graphic in white" ✅
- "Export the neighborhood icon in #85AFCC" ✅

### How It Works:
1. **Detects keywords**: export, download, get me, looking to download
2. **Extracts asset name**: Whatever you mention (house icon, wordmark, etc.)
3. **Extracts color**: Color names or hex codes
4. **Searches Figma**: Finds matching asset with fuzzy search
5. **Shows download button**: In the chat message
6. **Exports SVG**: With your requested color applied

---

## 🔍 Backend Test (Verify It's Working)

Test directly via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat-simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "download the house icon in lawn"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 5 "export_data"
```

**Should show:**
```json
"export_data": {
  "node_name": "house icon",
  "color": "#1B8751",
  "file_key": "3x616Uy5sRIDXcXHlNzyB7"
}
```

If this works, it's just a browser caching issue!

## 🚀 After Browser Refresh

Try these to test the generic system:

1. **"Download the house icon in lawn"**
   - Should work ✅

2. **"Export the wordmark in dusk"**
   - Should work ✅

3. **"Get me the [any icon name] in vista blue"**
   - Should work for any recognizable asset ✅

## 💡 If Asset Not Found

If you request an asset that doesn't exist:
- Download button won't appear (correct behavior)
- Or export will fail with friendly error
- Try asking: "What assets are in the Brand Asset Kit?"

---
