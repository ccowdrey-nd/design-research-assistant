## 🖼️ How Image Analysis Now Works

### Automatic Creative Type Detection

When you upload an image, the analyzer:
1. **Detects type** (email vs. ad vs. other) based on aspect ratio
2. **Retrieves relevant examples** from approved designs
3. **Compares your upload** to the approved patterns
4. **Provides specific feedback** referencing the examples

### Email Upload Example

**You upload:** Email mockup

**Analyzer automatically:**
- ✅ Detects it's an email (tall/narrow format)
- ✅ Loads approved email examples (Acquisition Emails Aug/Sept/Oct)
- ✅ Compares colors to brand palette
- ✅ Compares layout to approved templates
- ✅ References example patterns in feedback

**Report might say:**
```
Color Usage: ✅
The green (#1B8751) matches Lawn from brand palette.

Comparison to Approved Examples:
This design follows the pattern from "Acquisition Emails August" 
with hero image at top and CTA button below. Consider:
- CTA button in approved examples uses Lawn (#1B8751) - yours uses correct color
- Header spacing matches the October template pattern

Recommendations:
- Increase logo size to match September template (currently appears smaller)
- Add more white space around CTA like in the approved August examples
```

### Ad Upload Example

**You upload:** Social media ad

**Analyzer automatically:**
- ✅ Detects it's an ad (square/landscape format)
- ✅ Loads approved ad templates
- ✅ Compares to Meta Ad Template patterns
- ✅ References approved design patterns

## 🎨 How It Improves Analysis

### Before (Generic Feedback):
```
"The layout looks professional. Consider using brand colors."
```

### After (Example-Based Feedback):
```
"This follows the pattern from Acquisition Emails August with:
✅ Lawn green (#1B8751) CTA button - matches approved templates
✅ Hero image placement - consistent with September examples
⚠️ Logo appears 17px - approved examples use 20px minimum

Recommendations:
- Increase logo to 20px like in October template
- Add 24px padding around CTA (reference August example)
- Consider using Dusk (#232F46) for headline text (common pattern in approved emails)"
