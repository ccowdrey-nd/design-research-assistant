## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Design Assistant

### 3.1 Move Service Account JSON
```bash
# Create credentials directory
mkdir -p /Users/chrissycowdrey/.cursor/design-assistant/credentials

# Move the downloaded JSON file there
mv ~/Downloads/nextdoor-design-assistant-*.json \
   /Users/chrissycowdrey/.cursor/design-assistant/credentials/google-service-account.json
```

### 3.2 Update Backend .env
Add these lines to `/Users/chrissycowdrey/.cursor/design-assistant/backend/.env`:

```bash
# Google Slides Configuration
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/chrissycowdrey/.cursor/design-assistant/credentials/google-service-account.json
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE` with the folder ID from step 2.3

---

## üîÑ Step 4: Sync Google Slides

### Via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync/slides \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force": false}'
```

### Or Via Web Interface:

2. Click **Admin** tab
3. Click **"Sync Google Slides"**
4. Wait for sync to complete

## üéØ What Gets Indexed

**From each presentation:**
- ‚úÖ Slide text content
- ‚úÖ Speaker notes (often contains research insights!)
- ‚úÖ Slide numbers
- ‚úÖ Presentation metadata
- ‚úÖ Last modified dates
- ‚úÖ Links back to original slides

**Perfect for UXR decks:**
- Research findings
- User quotes
- Insights and recommendations
- Design implications
- Data and statistics

---

## üí¨ What You Can Ask After Setup

### UXR Insights:
- "What did we learn from recent user research?"
- "Show me insights about [feature]"
- "What do users say about [topic]?"
- "Recent UXR findings?"

### Find Presentations:
- "Link to the [research name] deck"
- "What UXR presentations do we have?"
- "Find slides about [topic]"

### Specific Findings:
- "User feedback on navigation?"
- "Research insights about ads?"
- "What pain points did we discover?"

---

## üß™ Test After Setup

```bash
# Test the Google Slides client
cd /Users/chrissycowdrey/.cursor/design-assistant/backend
source venv/bin/activate

python3 << 'EOF'
from integrations.google_slides import google_slides_client

# List presentations
presentations = google_slides_client.list_presentations_in_folder()
print(f"Found {len(presentations)} presentations")

for pres in presentations[:5]:
    print(f"  - {pres['name']}")
EOF
```

---

## üìä Expected Results

After sync, your database will include:
- All text from UXR presentations
- Speaker notes with insights
- Searchable research findings
- Linked back to original slides

**Example query after sync:**
```
User: "What did we learn about user onboarding?"

Bot: "Based on the UXR deck 'Onboarding Research Q3 2025':
     
     - 65% of users struggled with [specific step]
     - Users wanted [specific feature]
     - Key insight: [finding from speaker notes]
     
     Source: Onboarding Research Q3 2025, Slide 12 [link]"
```

## üîí Security Notes

- Service account has read-only access
- No write permissions needed
- Credentials stored locally (in .gitignore)
- Only accesses shared folder

---

## üí° Tips

**Folder organization:**
- Put all UXR decks in one folder
- Subfolders are included
- Tag presentations consistently
- Use descriptive names

**Speaker notes:**
- Add detailed insights in speaker notes
- These get indexed and are searchable
- Great for context that's not on slides

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete Step 1-3** above (15 minutes total)
2. **Sync slides** via Admin panel
3. **Ask UXR questions** in chat
4. **Get instant insights!**
