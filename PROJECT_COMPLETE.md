## 🚀 Next Steps

**Option A: Start Using Now**
- Everything works without Google Slides
- Your team can use it immediately
- Add Google Slides later when ready

**Option B: Add Google Slides First**
1. Follow GOOGLE_SLIDES_SETUP.md
2. Create service account (15 min)
3. Share UXR folder
4. Sync slides
5. Start asking UXR questions!

**Option C: Deploy to Production**
- Follow DEPLOYMENT.md
- Set up Okta for secure access
- Deploy to internal server
- Share company-wide

---

## 💡 Recommended Approach

1. **Today**: Share http://localhost:3000 with your design team
2. **This week**: Gather feedback, add Google Slides
3. **Next week**: Deploy to production with Okta

---

## 📞 Ready When You Are!

**To add Google Slides:**
- I can walk you through the Google Cloud setup
- Or follow the detailed guides (GOOGLE_SLIDES_SETUP.md, UXR_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- Takes 15 minutes, adds powerful UXR search

**To deploy to production:**
- Follow DEPLOYMENT.md
- Set up Okta authentication
- Deploy to internal server
- ~2-4 hours total
